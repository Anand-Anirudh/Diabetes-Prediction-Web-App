# Diabetes-Prediction-Web-App
# Diabetes Prediction

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Data

The data for the following example is originally from the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/) and is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The data contains information on females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage 
    
### Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, **Outcome**. 

Predictor variables includes:

    1. Pregnancies
    2. BMI
    3. Insulin Level
    4. Age
    5. Blood Pressure 
    6. Skin Thickness 
    7. Diabetes Pedigree Function

### Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)  
- Data gathering 
- Descriptive Analysis 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling
